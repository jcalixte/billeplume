# billeplume

Bille plume is a blog app where we ensure you are on the best mood for creation.

Choose a _font_, a _color_, a _music_ (coming soon!) and let words flow!

You can create articles that can be everything you want! An article of your blog, a new chapter of your book. You can even publish it when it is ready on [Plume Bille](https://plumebille.azurewebsites.net)!

# How does it work?

## Fonts

Fonts are important, not necessarly for focus, but they help for a better satisfaction in your writings. And they are the best to define a theme of your content.

## Colors

Bille plume has this beautiful gradient background. Colors create emotions. Bille plume goes from a pastel color at the top to a white color at the bottom. We insist in putting content above everything and we think that the white color is best when you already are in your zone after 200 words written.

## Musics

Musics help focus on your work and put you in an ambient zen atmosphere.

# A real app

Even if Bille plume is a website, everything you write is on your device. That's why you can work offline.

# Techical part

Bille plume has been made thanks to:

- [vuejs](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
- [typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
- [couchdb](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/)
- [pouchdb](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb)

The CouchDb server is hosted on a
[raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) and works pretty well!
